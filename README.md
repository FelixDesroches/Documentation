# Documentation

Welcome to our documentation repository! Here, you will find a wealth of resources to support our group's activities and projects. 

## Writing Guidelines

### File names

All filenames must adhere to the following format: `CATEGORY-title`. The `CATEGORY` can be one of the following:

1. *GUIDE*: Provides a framework for writing stuff (article, thesis, code).
2. *HOWTO*: Outlines step-by-step instructions to accomplish specific tasks, predominantly related to computers but not limited to them. 
3. *PROTOCOL*: Describes the technical steps required for experimental tasks. 
4. *TECHREP*: Offers explanations or summaries of articles, books, or general concepts. 

The `title` should be concise, informative, and accurately represent the document's content. It should be written in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

### File format

We have chosen [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) as our preferred format for documentation. Markdown offers several advantages, including its universal compatibility, lightweight nature, and simplicity. It can be easily edited and viewed on various platforms, such as GitHub. To enhance your Markdown editing experience, we recommend using [Typora](https://typora.io). Typora also supports LaTeX equations, enabling advanced mathematical notation within our documents.

Please note that for longer documents, the use of `pdf` format is also acceptable, provided that it is written in `LaTeX`.

### Miscellaneous

1. All documents should be written in English.
2. Strive for clear and concise writing, ensuring that the information is easily understandable.
3. Remember, documentation is an ongoing process, and collaboration is key to maintaining its quality. If you encounter any gaps or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contribute or discuss within the group.
